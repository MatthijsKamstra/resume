# Resume

If you search for resume on Github you will see a lot of repos that covers this problem:  **How to create a resume / CV / Curriculum Vitae**.

I'm not different; I like to reinvent the wheel (because my wheel is rounder!)

But I will learn from others: in my case from https://jsonresume.org/>.

This project is `resume.json` but done with Haxe. Because Haxe transpiles to a couple of System targets I am not limited to a specific language.

Language that I cover (with Haxe):

- cpp (C++)
- cs (C#)
- node.js (without installing npm packages)
- python
- java
- neko
- lua


# About resume.json

A couple years back I ran into this project <https://jsonresume.org/>

> JSON Resume
> The open source initiative to create a JSON-based standard for resumes. For developers, by developers.

It seemed a good idea but I had no use for it.


Recently a colleague of mine needed a resume and I remembered this.
Now the project seems dead and most of the website is not working.

I still think it's a great idea, so I wanted to experiment with it.

After working with it, I only can say that it's a good idea. But currently it doesn't work properly.


Currently it's written in node.js and JavaScript.

We can probably do that better with Haxe!
So let's start a Haxe system variant for it.
